# Titanic-Machine-Learning-
This is the Titanic ML competition â€“ A challenge to dive into ML competitions on Kaggle platform.
The competition is simple: use machine learning to create a model that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck.

I've created two notebooks, on the first one I analyse the data of the passengers on board of the Titanic so I can obtain important features, on the second one  I've created three different model to solve the classification problem obtaining 0.77511 of accuracy.
