# Titanic-Machine-Learning-
This is the Titanic ML competition â€“ A challenge to dive into ML competitions on Kaggle platform.
The competition is simple: use machine learning to create a model that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck.

On the notebook I analyse the data of the passengers on board of the Titanic, I've created three different model to solve the classification problem obtaining 0.77511 of accuracy.
